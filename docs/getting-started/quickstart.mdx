You can create **public** and **private** brains.

<AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Private" icon="lock">

### Ask Questions to a Brain

Quivr is designed to answer your questions by leveraging the knowledge that you've uploaded to it. Here's how you can ask questions:

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Quivr" icon="searchengin">
  Go to [Quivr](https://quivr.app) and login to your account.
</Step>
<Step title="Select a Brain" icon="database">
  Select the brain you want to ask a question to. A brain in Quivr is a knowledge base that you or someone else has created. If you haven't created a brain yet, you'll need to do that first.
</Step>
<Step title="Ask Your Question" icon="question">
  There should be a text input field where you can type your question. Enter your question into this field.
</Step>
<Step title="Submit Your Question" icon="check">
  Submit your question. Depending on the platform, this might involve pressing enter, clicking a button, or performing some other action.
</Step>
<Step title="Wait for the Answer" icon="clock">
  Quivr will process your question and provide an answer. The time it takes to get an answer will depend on the complexity of your question and the size of the brain you're asking.
</Step>
</Steps>

Remember, Quivr is only as smart as the knowledge you've given it. If it doesn't know the answer to a question, consider adding more information to your brain.

### Custom Personality 

You can **customize** the personality of Quivr by changing the **prompt** of your brain. You could tell your brain to always answer with a **funny** or **serious** tone or act like a **robot** or a **human**.
