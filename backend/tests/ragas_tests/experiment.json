[{"question":"What is the purpose of the SLS RS-25 engine testing?","contexts":["\n\nAt Johnson\u2019s Mission Control Center (MCC), flight controllers simulated part of Orion\u2019s uncrewed flight to the Moon for Artemis I in June 2019. In early 2020, tests simulated launch through outbound powered flyby to the Moon, and return powered flyby from the Moon through entry, descent, and landing. Both tests were joint operations between Lockheed Martin and NASA Flight Operations allowing the teams to do real time monitoring and commanding of Orion at the Integrated Test Lab in Denver and from the MCC.\n\nArtemis II Orion Pressure Vessel Fabrication and Delivery The Orion pressure vessel for the Artemis II mission with crew was assembled at NASA\u2019s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. The vessel is the primary structure that holds the pressurized atmosphere astronauts will breathe and work in while in the vacuum of deep space. It consists of seven large aluminum pieces that are joined together using friction-stir welding to produce a strong, yet light-weight, air- tight capsule. The pressure vessel was loaded into the crew module transportation fixture and then lowered onto a heavy equipment semi- trailer for the nearly 700-mile journey over land to Kennedy in August 2018.\n\nSLS RS-25 Engine Testing\n\nAcceptance testing is complete for all 16 RS-25 engines that served as former space shuttle main engines. Tests at Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, have shown that the engines can perform at the higher power level needed to launch the super heavy-lift SLS rocket. NASA tested the first SLS flight engine in March 2016 and completed acceptance testing in April 2019. Testing included certifying new controllers (plus one spare) to be used by the heritage RS-25 engines. Altogether, the agency has conducted\n\n32 developmental and flight engine tests for a total of 14,754 seconds\u2014more than four hours \u2013 of cumulative hot fire. Tests with development engines also tested new parts for future engines. Aerojet Rocketdyne made these parts with advanced manufacturing techniques, such as additive manufacturing and have the potential to increase reliability and sustainability of the engines.\n\nSLS Booster Testing The SLS boosters are modeled after the space shuttle boosters but have an additional segment to provide more power and several other upgrades. The boosters completed five full-up test firings in a horizontal position with the final qualification motor test in June 2016 at Northrop Grumman\u2019s facility in in Promontory, Utah. While the boosters are using metal casings and parts that were flown on space shuttle missions, they have many new and upgraded parts including new insulation and avionics systems to control flight that have been tested at Kennedy Space Center where they are assembled and outfitted. The booster motor segments for the first two Artemis missions are assembled and ready for stacking with other booster components at Kennedy. Teams have started testing small solid rocket motors that will help the agency build next-generation solid rocket boosters for future SLS flights.\n\nSLS Wind Tunnel Testing\n\nThe SLS team has completed extensive wind tunnel testing at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field California, Langley, and Marshall. These tests use scale rocket models to study how the vibration, base heating, and other environments affect the launch vehicle designs for both the Block 1 and Block 1B SLS configurations.\n\n47\n\n48\n\nSLS Acoustic Testing Researchers at Plum Brook Station completed a development test on a proposed design of acoustic panels for the SLS Universal Stage Adapter. The adapter will connect SLS and Orion on the future configurations of the rocket and provide additional cargo space. Given the extreme sound produced by the world\u2019s most powerful rocket, this test series, conducted at Plum Brook\u2019s Reverberant Acoustic Test Facility, provided data for acoustic modeling to ensure future payloads aboard the second configuration of SLS, called Block 1B, are protected from the high levels of noise and vibration experienced during launch. Even the Block 1 configuration of the rocket generates significant acoustic vibrations. Acoustic testing with a full-scale model of the SLS Block 1 was conducted early in the program at Marshall.\n\nSLS Structural Testing\n\nEngineers at Marshall completed structural testing on the 212-foot core stage and the upper part of the rocket, which includes the stage that sends the Orion spacecraft to the Moon. These tests help verify models showing the structural design can survive flight. The core has five main structures that have all undergone extensive testing. Structural testing is complete for three of the four largest structures: the engine section, the intertank, and the liquid hydrogen tank. The liquid oxygen tank has completed baseline testing. In May 2017, the\n\nparts of the rocket that make up the upper part of the rocket for Artemis I completed integrated structural testing.

They also will pre-position dust cleaning equipment to minimize the amount of lunar soil that gets tracked back into the cabin. The crew will spend approximately four hours outside, conducting dedicated science and technology demonstration activities. The scope of exploration will be constrained by the ability to return to the lander should a failure occur. If the LTV can be delivered to the landing site region before the crew arrives, the distance they cover on each moonwalk will greatly expand.\n\nAfter completing this historic expedition on the lunar surface, the crew will launch from the surface to rendezvous with Orion and their crewmates in lunar orbit.

The PPE also provides accommodations for science and technology demonstration payloads.\n\nNorthrop Grumman of Falls Church, Virginia, is developing the HALO, which will be the initial crew cabin for astronauts visiting the Gateway. Its primary purpose is to provide basic life support needs for the visiting astronauts after they arrive in the Orion and prepare for their trip to the lunar surface. It will provide command, control, and data handling capabilities; energy storage and power distribution; thermal control; communications and tracking capabilities; as well as environmental control and life support systems to augment the Orion spacecraft and support crew members. It also will have several docking ports for visiting vehicles and future modules, as well as space for science and stowage.\n\nCargo deliveries, initially provided by SpaceX of Hawthorne, California, will service the Gateway with pressurized and unpressurized cargo, including food and water for crew, science instruments, and supplies for the Gateway and lunar surface expeditions.\n\nOnce in lunar orbit, the Gateway will enter a period of scientific operations. Designed to operate autonomously and with internationally agreed-upon interoperability standards, it will provide a unique platform to conduct science investigations in deep space and outside the protection of the Earth\u2019s Van Allen radiation belts.

Both the ICPS and the RL10 have served on numerous flights of the United Launch Alliance Delta IV rocket with the RL10 just completing its 500th flight, and both have completed extensive testing.\n\nSLS Core Stage Green Run Testing The four Artemis I RS-25 engines are attached to the core stage, manufactured by Boeing, which was delivered to Stennis in January 2020 and is undergoing Green Run testing, a thorough checkout of the new rocket stage that has never flown before. Green Run testing will culminate with firing all four engines at the same time, just as they will operate during launch. There are eight test cases that make up Green Run testing. Teams completed the first test in January 2020, before pausing test operations in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. After resuming testing in May, teams have steadily progressed through the test cases, completing the fifth test in September, and preparing for a hot fire test in the fall.\n\nSLS Flight Software and Avionics Testing The core stage flight computers and avionics are distributed throughout the rocket and have undergone extensive qualification testing in a laboratory and will now be tested during the Green Run. Flight software for the avionics is in the final phase of testing in a systems integration laboratory that uses avionics identical to flight hardware. The flight software has been tested by flying thousands of simulated launches and flights replicating both nominal and\n\ncontingency operations. Avionics testing has been completed for the other SLS propulsion element that launches the rocket, the twin solid rocket boosters.\n\nSLS Pathfinder Practice In 2019, engineers and technicians practiced offloading, maneuvering and stacking the 212-foot-long SLS core stage using a full-scale mock-up called a pathfinder. In January 2020, engineers, technicians and crane operators practiced lifting and stacking operations with pathfinder segments of Northrop Grumman\u2019s solid rocket boosters inside High Bay 4 of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy. More booster pathfinder operations are planned before the arrival of flight hardware this summer.\n\nSLS Testing and Progress on Artemis II and Future Missions\n\nBoeing has built all the structures for the second core stage for Artemis II and they are being outfitted at NASA\u2019s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. The liquid hydrogen tank for Artemis III is built. Both the initial and evolved designs of SLS use the core stage and boosters. Much of the testing used to qualify these elements for Artemis I also applies to future flights. For Artemis II, the booster motor segments and RS-25 engines are also completed. The booster aft and forward skirts must be refurbished and outfitted at the Booster\n\nFabrication Facility at Kennedy. The upper part of the rocket for Artemis II consisting of the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS), the Orion Stage Adapter (OSA) and the Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter (LVSA) are being manufactured in Alabama. For Artemis I, both the OSA and ICPS are at Kennedy, and the LVSA is nearly complete and will shipped to Kennedy later this year.\n\nMobile Launcher and Launch Pad 39B The mobile launcher\u2014the 380-foot-tall ground structure that will be used to assemble, process and launch SLS \u2013 has gone through a series of tests both in the VAB and Launch Pad 39B at Kennedy. Crawler Transporter 2 (CT2) completed a test rollout of the mobile launcher for integrated testing at newly renovated Launch Pad 39B, validating it can communicate effectively with the facility systems and ground systems to perform appropriately during launch. These multi- element verification and validation tests included testing the sound suppression system, loading the cryogenic fuel system, a simultaneous umbilical swing test, and more. CT2 returned the mobile launcher to the VAB for modal testing with the mobile launcher sitting on the mount pedestals as well as with CT2 sharing the load. Exploration Ground Systems also conducted a six-hour pressurization test of the liquid oxygen tank at Launch Pad 39B, which has been upgraded for the SLS rocket. SLS will use both liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants. An initial test of xenon lights took place with the mobile launcher on the pad in October 2019, and additional lighting plans are in design.\n\nSimulated Propellant Loading\n\nIn August 2019, technicians at Kennedy simulated loading propellants into a replicated test tank for Orion, including putting on the Self-Contained Atmospheric Protective Ensemble (SCAPE) suits. SCAPE suits are used in operations involving toxic propellants and are supplied with air either through a hardline or through a self-contained environmental control unit. After donning the suits, the technicians completed a tanking to test the system before Orion arrives for processing. During preparations for launch, these teams will be responsible for loading the Orion vehicle with propellants prior to transportation to the VAB, where it will be secured atop the SLS rocket.\n\n49\n"],"ground_truth":"The purpose of the SLS Core Stage Green Run Testing is to thoroughly check out the new rocket stage that has never flown before.

Over the course of eight tests, engineers evaluated the performance of the parachute system, consisting of 11 parachutes, during normal landing sequences as well as several failure scenarios and a variety of potential aerodynamic conditions to ensure astronauts can return safely from deep space missions. The system has a series of cannon-like mortars, pyrotechnic bolt cutters, and more than 30 miles of Kevlar lines attaching the top of the spacecraft to the 36,000 square feet of parachute canopy material. In about 10 minutes of descent through Earth\u2019s atmosphere, everything must deploy in precise sequence to slow Orion and its crew from about 300 mph to a relatively gentle 20 mph for splashdown in the ocean.\n\n43\n\n44\n\nOrion Crew Module Uprighting System Testing\n\nIn March 2019, off the coast of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, engineers tested the crew module uprighting system (CMUS) to ensure the Orion capsule can be oriented right-side up once it returns from its deep space missions. When Orion splashes down in the ocean, it can settle in one of two positions. The CMUS deploys a series of five, bright orange airbags to flip the capsule right-side up in the event the Orion lands upside down. It takes less than four minutes for the system to upright the capsule to help protect the astronauts inside that are\n\nreturning home from future deep space missions. Several tests performed with a mockup of the Orion crew capsule demonstrated that even if one of the airbags failed to inflate, the CMUS would still be able to perform as intended. The system was previously tested in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, a giant pool at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, primarily used for astronaut training, as well as off the coast of Galveston, Texas. Engineers also partnered with the Coast Guard in the Atlantic Ocean to test the CMUS in more challenging waves, similar to those where Orion is expected to land.\n\nOrion\u2019s Launch Abort System Testing Orion\u2019s launch abort system (LAS), designed to carry crew to safety in the event of an emergency during launch or ascent, is being rigorously tested before the first crewed Artemis mission. The LAS consists of three solid rocket motors: the abort motor pulls the crew module away from the launch vehicle; the attitude control motor steers and orients the capsule; then the jettison motor ignites to separate the LAS from Orion prior to parachute deployment and to ensure a safe crew landing. The LAS is managed by Langley and NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The attitude control motor and jettison motor have each been tested for the third and final time during hot, ambient and cold conditions. The abort motor has been tested twice. The final abort motor test is scheduled for 2022, marking the final test to qualify the LAS for the Artemis II mission with crew. In 2010, Orion\u2019s LAS successfully tested the system from the launch pad during a pad abort test at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. In July 2019, an ascent abort test at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida successfully demonstrated the system could outrun a speeding rocket and pull astronauts to safety under the greatest aerodynamic forces expected during ascent.\n\nOrion Service Module Structural Testing\n\nFrom November 2015 through March 2017, NASA, ESA (European Space Agency) and Airbus, ESA\u2019s lead contractor for Orion\u2019s European Service Module, completed evaluation of the full-size test version of the service module at the Space Environments Complex at NASA\u2019s Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, Ohio. These tests verified the flight readiness and structural integrity of the service module, which will carry air, nitrogen and water for the crew, as well as the spacecraft in-space propulsion and power systems. The first test focused on the\n\nsuccessful deployment of the spacecraft\u2019s solar array wings. The deployment of the 24-foot wing qualification model confirmed the array unfurled properly and locked into place and that all of the mechanisms functioned as expected. Next, the test article moved into the world\u2019s most powerful reverberant acoustic test chamber, where it was blasted with more than 150 decibels and up to 10,000 hertz of sound pressure. The service module was then placed atop a vibration table to simulate launching on the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket.

This crucial flight test will demonstrate the performance of the SLS rocket on its maiden flight and gather engineering data throughout before Orion returns on a high-speed Earth reentry at Mach 32, or 24,500 miles per hour. The high speed lunar velocity reentry is the top mission priority and a necessary test of the heat shield\u2019s performance as it enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere, heating to nearly 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit\u2014about half as hot as the surface of the sun\u2014before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean for retrieval and post-flight engineering assessment.\n\nFor this uncrewed configuration, engineering equipment will fly in place of astronaut-essential elements. Instead of the cockpit displays and controls and life support systems that will fly on the first crewed flight, this first flight will carry the data-gathering tools needed to validate performance and compare predictive models with actual flight data. Over the course of the four-to-six-week mission, Orion will travel more than 1.4 million miles prior to returning to Earth, surpassing Apollo 13\u2019s record for distance traveled from Earth in a spacecraft designed for humans. This mission will also deploy 13 CubeSats to conduct new scientific investigations and new technology demonstrations that will improve our knowledge of the deep space environment, while engaging a broader set of universities, international partners, and private companies in lunar exploration than ever before on a single mission.\n\nSCIENCE\n\nArtemis I will leverage excess volume on the massive SLS rocket to carry 13 CubeSats to deep space and deploy them to conduct science and technology research. These \u201chitchhiker\u201d payloads are provided by NASA, U.S. companies, academic institutions and international partners. Five of them will return important data about the lunar environment to inform future Artemis missions.\n\n15\n\nSpace Launch System Mock Up arrives at Kennedy for Testing. NASA\u2019s Pegasus Barge arrived at the Launch Complex 39 turn basin wharf at Kennedy Space Center in Florida to make its first delivery to Kennedy in support of the agency\u2019s Artemis missions. The upgraded 310-foot-long barge arrived September 27, 2019, ferrying the 212-foot-long Space Launch System rocket core stage pathfinder. Weighing in at 228,000 pounds, the Pathfinder is a full-scale mock-up of the rocket\u2019s core stage and will be used to validate ground support equipment and demonstrate it can be integrated with Kennedy facilities.\n\nPreparations for Artemis I are well underway. Production is complete for the SLS engines\u2014comprising four RS-25 liquid rocket engines, two solid rocket boosters, the massive core stage, and the interim cryogenic propulsion stage that provides Orion\u2019s final push toward the Moon\u2014and all are completing preflight tests. Beyond significant ground tests when NASA has fired elements of the rocket from test stands in Mississippi, Utah, and Alabama, a fully integrated series of ground tests will take place at Kennedy Space Center before a final Flight Readiness Review prior to the Artemis I launch.\n\nOrion\u2019s maiden flight test, Exploration Flight Test-1, flew on December 5, 2014.

Both the ICPS and the RL10 have served on numerous flights of the United Launch Alliance Delta IV rocket with the RL10 just completing its 500th flight, and both have completed extensive testing.\n\nSLS Core Stage Green Run Testing The four Artemis I RS-25 engines are attached to the core stage, manufactured by Boeing, which was delivered to Stennis in January 2020 and is undergoing Green Run testing, a thorough checkout of the new rocket stage that has never flown before. Green Run testing will culminate with firing all four engines at the same time, just as they will operate during launch. There are eight test cases that make up Green Run testing. Teams completed the first test in January 2020, before pausing test operations in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. After resuming testing in May, teams have steadily progressed through the test cases, completing the fifth test in September, and preparing for a hot fire test in the fall.\n\nSLS Flight Software and Avionics Testing The core stage flight computers and avionics are distributed throughout the rocket and have undergone extensive qualification testing in a laboratory and will now be tested during the Green Run. Flight software for the avionics is in the final phase of testing in a systems integration laboratory that uses avionics identical to flight hardware. The flight software has been tested by flying thousands of simulated launches and flights replicating both nominal and\n\ncontingency operations. Avionics testing has been completed for the other SLS propulsion element that launches the rocket, the twin solid rocket boosters.\n\nSLS Pathfinder Practice In 2019, engineers and technicians practiced offloading, maneuvering and stacking the 212-foot-long SLS core stage using a full-scale mock-up called a pathfinder. In January 2020, engineers, technicians and crane operators practiced lifting and stacking operations with pathfinder segments of Northrop Grumman\u2019s solid rocket boosters inside High Bay 4 of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy. More booster pathfinder operations are planned before the arrival of flight hardware this summer.\n\nSLS Testing and Progress on Artemis II and Future Missions\n\nBoeing has built all the structures for the second core stage for Artemis II and they are being outfitted at NASA\u2019s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans. The liquid hydrogen tank for Artemis III is built. Both the initial and evolved designs of SLS use the core stage and boosters. Much of the testing used to qualify these elements for Artemis I also applies to future flights. For Artemis II, the booster motor segments and RS-25 engines are also completed. The booster aft and forward skirts must be refurbished and outfitted at the Booster\n\nFabrication Facility at Kennedy. The upper part of the rocket for Artemis II consisting of the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS), the Orion Stage Adapter (OSA) and the Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter (LVSA) are being manufactured in Alabama. For Artemis I, both the OSA and ICPS are at Kennedy, and the LVSA is nearly complete and will shipped to Kennedy later this year.\n\nMobile Launcher and Launch Pad 39B The mobile launcher\u2014the 380-foot-tall ground structure that will be used to assemble, process and launch SLS \u2013 has gone through a series of tests both in the VAB and Launch Pad 39B at Kennedy. Crawler Transporter 2 (CT2) completed a test rollout of the mobile launcher for integrated testing at newly renovated Launch Pad 39B, validating it can communicate effectively with the facility systems and ground systems to perform appropriately during launch. These multi- element verification and validation tests included testing the sound suppression system, loading the cryogenic fuel system, a simultaneous umbilical swing test, and more. CT2 returned the mobile launcher to the VAB for modal testing with the mobile launcher sitting on the mount pedestals as well as with CT2 sharing the load. Exploration Ground Systems also conducted a six-hour pressurization test of the liquid oxygen tank at Launch Pad 39B, which has been upgraded for the SLS rocket. SLS will use both liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants. An initial test of xenon lights took place with the mobile launcher on the pad in October 2019, and additional lighting plans are in design.\n\nSimulated Propellant Loading\n\nIn August 2019, technicians at Kennedy simulated loading propellants into a replicated test tank for Orion, including putting on the Self-Contained Atmospheric Protective Ensemble (SCAPE) suits. SCAPE suits are used in operations involving toxic propellants and are supplied with air either through a hardline or through a self-contained environmental control unit. After donning the suits, the technicians completed a tanking to test the system before Orion arrives for processing. During preparations for launch, these teams will be responsible for loading the Orion vehicle with propellants prior to transportation to the VAB, where it will be secured atop the SLS rocket.\n\n49\n"],"ground_truth":"The parts of the SLS rocket used in the Orion mission to the Moon include the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS), the Orion Stage Adapter (OSA), and the Launch Vehicle Stage Adapter (LVSA).

The goal, if mass allows, is for the crew to conduct four planned EVAs, and reserve additional consumables for one unplanned contingency EVA. In this scenario, days 1, 2, 4, and 5 will be primarily focused on moonwalks to conduct science and technology demonstrations, with the latter part of day 5 dedicated to site cleanup. The cleanup may involve securing tools or other moonwalk instruments for use on future expeditions, and will require placement far enough from the lander that they don\u2019t cause a hazard during liftoff. Day 3 will be for crew rest, conducting science inside the ascent vehicle, and public engagement activities.\n\nprocesses\n\nThe study of lunar volatile cycles and the in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) potential of resources for lunar exploration and beyond\n\nThe impact history of the Earth-Moon system \u2022 A platform to study the universe and geospace, including Earth\n\nRecord of the ancient Sun \u2022 A platform for experimental science in the lunar environment\n\nSee Appendix 1 for more on the Artemis Science Strategy.\n\n23\n\nMoonwalks will begin with cabin and suit hardware preparation once the crew has depressurized the lander. Outside on the Moon, the two crew members will spend about 1.5 hours on set-up tasks including configuring the lander for contingency return, and unpacking tools and equipment for the objectives of the day. They also will pre-position dust cleaning equipment to minimize the amount of lunar soil that gets tracked back into the cabin. The crew will spend approximately four hours outside, conducting dedicated science and technology demonstration activities. The scope of exploration will be constrained by the ability to return to the lander should a failure occur. If the LTV can be delivered to the landing site region before the crew arrives, the distance they cover on each moonwalk will greatly expand.\n\nAfter completing this historic expedition on the lunar surface, the crew will launch from the surface to rendezvous with Orion and their crewmates in lunar orbit. With their pristinely preserved samples from the Moon, the crew will prepare for the three-day trip back to Earth.\n\nWhen Artemis III lands the first woman and next man on the Moon in 2024, America will demonstrate a new level of global space leadership. With lunar exploration capability re-established, NASA and the world will be ready to build a sustained presence on the lunar surface in preparation for human exploration of Mars.\n\nThe Gateway\n\nThe first two Gateway modules, the PPE and the HALO, will be integrated on the ground and launched together on a single rocket in 2023.\n\nMaxar Technologies of Westminster, Colorado, is developing the PPE, leveraging heritage systems from the company\u2019s geostationary orbit satellites.

The PPE also provides accommodations for science and technology demonstration payloads.\n\nNorthrop Grumman of Falls Church, Virginia, is developing the HALO, which will be the initial crew cabin for astronauts visiting the Gateway. Its primary purpose is to provide basic life support needs for the visiting astronauts after they arrive in the Orion and prepare for their trip to the lunar surface. It will provide command, control, and data handling capabilities; energy storage and power distribution; thermal control; communications and tracking capabilities; as well as environmental control and life support systems to augment the Orion spacecraft and support crew members. It also will have several docking ports for visiting vehicles and future modules, as well as space for science and stowage.\n\nCargo deliveries, initially provided by SpaceX of Hawthorne, California, will service the Gateway with pressurized and unpressurized cargo, including food and water for crew, science instruments, and supplies for the Gateway and lunar surface expeditions.\n\nOnce in lunar orbit, the Gateway will enter a period of scientific operations. Designed to operate autonomously and with internationally agreed-upon interoperability standards, it will provide a unique platform to conduct science investigations in deep space and outside the protection of the Earth\u2019s Van Allen radiation belts.
